This repository contains the notebook (NonEqGE.ipynb) and CplexA package (CplexA.py) needed to reproduce Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6 of reference [1]. The notebook is provided to ensure the reproducibility of the analyses and has not been optimized for general usage. It was executed with python 3.10.12 from the conda 23.5.2 (https://conda.io/) distribution with the additional packages CplexA [2], matplotlib 3.7.2, numpy 1.25.1, sympy 1.12, and scipy 1.11.1.
